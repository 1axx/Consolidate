    <h1>Instructions on Downloading and Using the .bat File</h1>

    <h2>1. Download the .bat File</h2>
    <p>Click the link below to download the <strong>Consolidation Script (.bat)</strong> file:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p>The file will automatically download to your computer.</p>

    <h2>2. Prepare Your Files</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a folder where you will store all the downloaded files you want to consolidate.</li>
        <li>Copy all the downloaded files into this folder.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Follow the Instructions in the Command Window</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The script will ask you to provide the name of the folder where your files are located (relative to the Downloads folder).</li>
        <li>It will then prompt you to name the new consolidated folder. You can use the default name or enter a custom name.</li>
        <li>The script will move all your files into the new folder and handle any duplicates by renaming them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Check Your Consolidated Files</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Once the script finishes, you will have a new folder containing all the consolidated files.</li>
        <li>You can find this folder in your Downloads directory or the specified location.</li>
    </ul>
