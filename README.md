# Instructions for Downloading and Using the .bat File

Follow these steps to download and use the `.bat` file to consolidate your files.

## 1. Download the .bat File
- Download the [Consolidation Script (.bat)](https://github.com/1axx/Consolidate).

## 2. Prepare Your Files
- Create a folder where you will store all the downloaded files you want to consolidate.
- Copy all the files you want to consolidate into this folder.

## 3. Run the .bat File
- Open the folder where you placed the `.bat` file.
- Double-click the `.bat` file to run it. A command window will open with instructions.

## 4. Follow the Instructions in the Command Window
- The script will ask for the location of your files (relative to your `Downloads` folder).
- You will be prompted to name the new consolidated folder. You can either use the default name or enter your own custom name.
- The script will move all your files into the new folder, handling duplicates by renaming them as needed.

## 5. Check Your Consolidated Files
- After the script finishes, you will find a new folder containing all the consolidated files.
- This folder will be located in your `Downloads` directory (or the specified directory of your choice).
